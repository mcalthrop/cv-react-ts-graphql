# important-instruction-reminders

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- ALWAYS create pull requests in draft mode using the --draft flag with `gh pr create`.
- ALWAYS use British English.

## Node.js Version Management

- ALWAYS run `source ~/.zshrc && nvm install` before executing any pnpm or node commands.
- This ensures the correct Node.js version is installed and activated based on `.nvmrc`.
